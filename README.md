## Overview

Welcome to my version of Rock, Paper and Scissors! :fist: :hand: :v:

This game was created using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

You get to compete against a computer for glory! 

Choose among rock:rock:, paper:page_facing_up:, or scissors:scissors:!

The computer will also make a random selection.

The first to 5 points wins :boom:

I had a lot fun making this game and I hope you enjoy it!
